# Ohm language support for Visual Studio Code

Adds syntax highlighting to Ohm (.ohm) files for Visual Studio Code. Ohm is a library and DSL for parsing and pattern matching. See [https://github.com/harc/ohm](https://github.com/harc/ohm) for details.

The extension is entirely based on [David Manning's](https://github.com/dlmanning/language-ohm) work.
